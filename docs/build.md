# Build System Documentation

## Overview

The build system is designed to provide a reliable and efficient way to compile, test, and validate the AI Orchestrator project.

## Build Scripts

### Main Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command runs the complete build pipeline:

1. Cleans the dist directory
2. Performs type checking
3. Compiles TypeScript
4. Runs tests

### Development Build

```bash
npm run build:dev
```

Runs TypeScript compiler in watch mode, automatically recompiling on file changes.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

Runs an optimized production build with:

- Removed source maps
- Removed comments
- Incremental builds
- Excluded test files

## Build Configuration

### TypeScript Configuration

- Base configuration: `tsconfig.json`
- Production configuration: `tsconfig.prod.json`

### Build Pipeline

The build pipeline is managed by `scripts/build.js` and includes:

- Clean step
- Type checking
- Compilation
- Test execution

## Build Artifacts

- Compiled JavaScript: `dist/*.js`
- Type definitions: `dist/*.d.ts`
- Build info: `dist/.tsbuildinfo`

## Build Validation

The build process includes several validation steps:

1. Type checking
2. Test execution
3. Output validation

## Troubleshooting

If the build fails:

1. Check the error message in the console
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure all TypeScript files compile without errors
4. Check test coverage requirements are met
