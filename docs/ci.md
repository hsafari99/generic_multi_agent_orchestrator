# Continuous Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the CI pipeline setup and requirements for the project.

## CI Pipeline

### Workflow
The CI pipeline runs on:
- Push to master/main branch
- Pull requests to master/main branch

### Jobs

#### Test Job
- Runs on Ubuntu latest
- Tests against Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Node.js
  3. Install dependencies
  4. Run linting
  5. Run type checking
  6. Run tests with coverage
  7. Upload coverage reports

#### Build Job
- Runs after successful test job
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Node.js 20.x
  3. Install dependencies
  4. Build production version
  5. Upload build artifacts

## Requirements

### GitHub Secrets
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Token for Codecov integration

### Node.js Versions
- 18.x (LTS)
- 20.x (LTS)

## Artifacts
- Build artifacts are retained for 7 days
- Coverage reports are uploaded to Codecov

## Best Practices
1. Keep CI pipeline fast and efficient
2. Run tests in parallel when possible
3. Cache dependencies to speed up builds
4. Use matrix builds for multiple Node.js versions
5. Upload artifacts for debugging
6. Maintain comprehensive test coverage
